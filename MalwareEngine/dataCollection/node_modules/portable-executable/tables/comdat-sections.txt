Constant, Value, Description
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_NODUPLICATES, 1, "The linker issues a multiply defined symbol error if this symbol is already defined."
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ANY, 2, "Any section defining the same COMDAT symbol may be linked; the rest are removed."
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_SAME_SIZE, 3, "The linker chooses an arbitrary section among the definitions for this symbol. A, multiply defined symbol error is issued if all definitions don’t have the same size."
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_EXACT_MATCH, 4, "The linker chooses an arbitrary section, among the definitions for this symbol. A, multiply defined symbol error is issued if all definitions don’t match exactly."
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ASSOCIATIVE, 5, "The section is linked if a certain other COMDAT section is linked. This other section is indicated by the Number field of the auxiliary symbol record for the section definition. Use of this setting is useful for definitions that have components in multiple sections (for example, code in one and data in another), but where all must be linked or discarded as a set."
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_LARGEST, 6, "The linker chooses the largest from the definitions for this symbol. If multiple definitions have this size the choice between them is arbitrary."
