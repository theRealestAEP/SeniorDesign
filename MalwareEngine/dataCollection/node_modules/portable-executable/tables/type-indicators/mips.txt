Constant, Value, Description
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_ABSOLUTE, 0x0000, "This relocation is ignored."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFHALF, 0x0001, "The high 16 bits of the target's 32-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFWORD, 0x0002, "The target's 32-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_JMPADDR, 0x0003, "The low 26 bits of the target's virtual address. This supports the MIPS J and JAL instructions."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFHI, 0x0004, "The high 16 bits of the target's 32-bit virtual address. Used for the first instruction in a two-instruction sequence that loads a full address. This relocation must be immediately followed by a PAIR relocations whose SymbolTableIndex contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFLO, 0x0005, "The low 16 bits of the target's virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_GPREL, 0x0006, "16-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_LITERAL, 0x0007, "Same as IMAGE_REL_MIPS_GPREL."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECTION, 0x000A, "The 16-bit section index of the section containing the target. This is used to support debugging information."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECREL, 0x000B, "The 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. This is used to support debugging information as well as static thread local storage."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECRELLO, 0x000C, "The low 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECRELHI, 0x000D, "The high 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. A PAIR relocation must immediately follow this on. The SymbolTableIndex of the PAIR relocation contains a signed 16-bit displacement, which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_JMPADDR16, 0x0010
"The low 26 bits of the target's virtual address. This supports the MIPS16 JAL instruction."
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFWORDNB, 0x0022, The target's 32-bit relative virtual address.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_PAIR, 0x0025, "This relocation is only valid when it immediately follows a REFHI or SECRELHI relocation. Its SymbolTableIndex contains a displacement and not an index into the symbol table."
