Constant, Value, Description
IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE, 0, "The fixup is skipped. This type can be used to pad a block."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH, 1, "The fixup adds the high 16 bits of the delta to the 16-bit field at Offset. The 16-bit field represents the high value of a 32-bit word."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW, 2, "The fixup adds the low 16 bits of the delta to the 16-bit field at Offset. The 16-bit field represents the low half of a 32-bit word."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW, 3, "The fixup applies the delta to the 32-bit field at Offset."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHADJ, 4, "The fixup adds the high 16 bits of the delta to the 16-bit field at Offset. The 16-bit field represents the high value of a 32-bit word. The low 16 bits of the 32-bit value are stored in the 16-bit word that follows this base relocation. This means that this base relocation occupies two slots."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_MIPS_JMPADDR, 5, "Fixup applies to a MIPS jump instruction."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_SECTION, 6, "Reserved for future use"
IMAGE_REL_BASED_REL32, 7, "Reserved for future use"
IMAGE_REL_BASED_MIPS_JMPADDR16, 9, "Fixup applies to a MIPS16 jump instruction."
IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64, 10, "This fixup applies the delta to the 64-bit field at Offset"
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH3ADJ, 11, "The fixup adds the high 16 bits of the delta to the 16-bit field at Offset. The 16-bit field represents the high value of a 48-bit word. The low 32 bits of the 48-bit value are stored in the 32-bit word that follows this base relocation. This means that this base relocation occupies three slots."
