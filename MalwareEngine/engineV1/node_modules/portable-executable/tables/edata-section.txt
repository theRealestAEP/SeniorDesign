Table Name, Description
Export Directory Table, "A table with just one row (unlike the debug directory). This table indicates the locations and sizes of the other export tables."
Export Address Table, "An array of RVAs of exported symbols. These are the actual addresses of the exported functions and data within the executable code and data sections. Other image files can import a symbol by using an index to this table (an ordinal) or, optionally, by using the public name that corresponds to the ordinal if one is defined."
Name Pointer Table,  "Array of pointers to the public export names, sorted in ascending order."
Ordinal Table, "Array of the ordinals that correspond to members of the Name Pointer Table. The correspondence is by position; therefore, the Name Pointer Table and the Ordinal Table must have the same number of members. Each ordinal is an index into the Export Address Table."
Export Name Table, "A series of null-terminated ASCII strings. Members of the Name Pointer Table point into this area. These names are the public names through which the symbols are imported and exported; they do not necessarily have to be the same as the private names used within the image file."
