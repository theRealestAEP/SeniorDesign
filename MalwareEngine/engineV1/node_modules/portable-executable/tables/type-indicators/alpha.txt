Constant, Value, Description
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_ABSOLUTE, 0x0000, "This relocation is ignored."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFLONG, 0x0001, "The target's 32-bit virtual address. This fixup is illegal in a PE32+ image unless the image has been sandboxed by clearing the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE bit in the File Header."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFQUAD, 0x0002, "The target's 64-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_GPREL32, 0x0003, "32-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_LITERAL, 0x0004, "16-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_LITUSE, 0x0005, "Reserved for future use."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_GPDISP, 0x0006, "Reserved for future use."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_BRADDR, 0x0007, "The 21-bit relative displacement to the target. This supports the Alpha relative branch instructions."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_HINT, 0x0008, "14-bit hints to the processor for the target of an Alpha jump instruction."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_INLINE_REFLONG, 0x0009, "The target's 32-bit virtual address split into high and low 16-bit parts. Either an ABSOLUTE or MATCH relocation must immediately follow this relocation. The high 16 bits of the target address are stored in the location identified by the INLINE_REFLONG relocation. The low 16 bits are stored four bytes later if the following relocation is of type ABSOLUTE or at a signed displacement given in the SymbolTableIndex if the following relocation is of type MATCH."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFHI, 0x000A, "The high 16 bits of the target’s 32-bit virtual address. Used for the first instruction in a two-instruction sequence that loads a full address. This relocation must be immediately followed by a PAIR relocations whose SymbolTableIndex contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFLO, 0x000B, "The low 16 bits of the target’s virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_PAIR, 0x000C, "This relocation is only valid when it immediately follows a REFHI , REFQ3, REFQ2, or SECRELHI relocation. Its SymbolTableIndex contains a displacement and not an index into the symbol table."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_MATCH, 0x000D, "This relocation is only valid when it immediately follows INLINE_REFLONG relocation. Its SymbolTableIndex contains the displacement in bytes of the location for the matching low address and not an index into the symbol table."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECTION, 0x000E, "The 16-bit section index of the section containing the target.  This is used to support debugging information."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECREL, 0x000F, "The 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. This is used to support debugging information as well as static thread local storage."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFLONGNB, 0x0010, "The target's 32-bit relative virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECRELLO, 0x0011, "The low 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECRELHI, 0x0012, "The high 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. A PAIR relocation must immediately follow this on. The SymbolTableIndex of the PAIR relocation contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFQ3, 0x0013, "The low 16 bits of the high 32 bits of the target's 64-bit virtual address. This relocation must be immediately followed by a PAIR relocations whose SymbolTableIndex contains a signed 32-bit displacement which is added to the 16 bits taken from the location being relocated. The 16 bits in the relocated location are shifted left by 32 before this addition."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFQ2, 0x0014, "The high 16 bits of the low 32 bits of the target's 64-bit virtual address. This relocation must be immediately followed by a PAIR relocations whose SymbolTableIndex contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFQ1, 0x0015, "The low 16 bits of the target’s 64-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_GPRELLO, 0x0016, "The low 16 bits of the 32-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_GPRELHI, 0x0017, "The high 16 bits of the 32-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
