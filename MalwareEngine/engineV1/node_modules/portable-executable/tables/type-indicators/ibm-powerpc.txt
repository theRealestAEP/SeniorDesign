Constant, Value, Description
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ABSOLUTE, 0x0000, "This relocation is ignored."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR64, 0x0001, "The target’s 64-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR32, 0x0002, "The target's 32-bit virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR24, 0x0003, "The low 24 bits of the target's virtual address. This is only valid when the target symbol is absolute and can be sign extended to its original value."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR16, 0x0004, "The low 16 bits of the target's virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR14, 0x0005, "The low 14 bits of the target's virtual address. This is only valid when the target symbol is absolute and can be sign extended to its original value."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_REL24, 0x0006, "A 24-bit PC-relative offset to the symbol’s location."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_REL14, 0x0007, "A 14-bit PC-relative offset to the symbol’s location."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_ADDR32NB, 0x000A, "The target's 32-bit relative virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_SECREL, 0x000B, "The 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. This is used to support debugging information as well as static thread local storage."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_SECTION, 0x000C, "The 16-bit section index of the section containing the target. This is used to support debugging information."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_SECREL16, 0x000F, "The 16-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. This is used to support debugging information as well as static thread local storage."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_REFHI, 0x0010, "The high 16 bits of the target’s 32-bit virtual address. Used for the first instruction in a two-instruction sequence that loads a full address. This relocation must be immediately followed by a PAIR relocations whose SymbolTableIndex contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_REFLO, 0x0011, The low 16 bits of the target's virtual address."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_PAIR, 0x0012, "This relocation is only valid when it immediately follows a REFHI or SECRELHI relocation. Its SymbolTableIndex contains a displacement and not an index into the symbol table."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_SECRELLO, 0x0013, "The low 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_SECRELHI, 0x0014, "The high 16 bits of the 32-bit offset of the target from the beginning of its section. A PAIR relocation must immediately follow this on. The SymbolTableIndex of the PAIR relocation contains a signed 16-bit displacement which is added to the upper 16 bits taken from the location being relocated."
IMAGE_REL_PPC_GPREL, 0x0015, "16-bit signed displacement of the target relative to the Global Pointer (GP) register."
